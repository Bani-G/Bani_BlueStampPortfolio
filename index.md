# Hexapod Robot
The hexapod is a six-legged robot that can be controlled to move in any direction. The six legs give it a dynamic and versatile range of motion.

# Final Milestone

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G1wfri5acvk?si=vUckQLzvb-4nGpFE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

For my final milestone, I built the controller and finished the entire build. The controller works via a bluetooth module that is attached to both the robot and the controller. My next steps will be to add my modifications which include a battery mount as well as a crane. I plan to build a new remote controller so that both the crane and robot can be controlled by one remote. To do this, I will research how the controller I just built works. Then I will build a new remote.

# Second Milestone

For my second milestone, I finished the robot. For this, I uploaded the code to the arduino and calibrated the legs of the robot. Calibrating the robot was very time consuming as it took a lot of time to precicesly line up the legs where I needed them to be. To calibrate the hexapod, I used the Processing applications. After some time, I eventually managed to finish and get the data saved to the arduino. The only thing left to complete is the controller.

For my first milestone, I have assembled the body of the hexapod robot. This just means attatching all the body parts to each other and wiring the robot. The only issue I had with my first milestone was the screwing of the screws as they were self tapping screws so they took more time and effort to screw in than normal screws. Also, I soon learned that attention to detail was important; I initially paid no attention to the orientation of certain plates, and later realized that they were meant to be flipped in the other direction. This led to tedious unscrewing and rescrewing of multiple mistakes. Another issue I had was screwing some plates on over the wires. I ended up having to unwire the robot and then screw the plates on, and then rewire under the plates.
My next steps are to build the controller and calibrate the robot. Then I will work on the software. Once this is complete I will be finished with the hexapod and will begin working on my modifications. I plan to make a grappling hook for the robot, give it the ability to walk up stairs and decorate it with LEDs to make it look pretty because right now it does not look pretty. I will explore my ideas for modifications more in depth once I finish the hexapod.

<!-- # Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Starter Project

For my starter project, I made the Weevil Eyes project. This is a small bug-like object whos eyes glow when it is dark. There is a light sensor which, when it doesn't detect any light, sends a signal to thie leds to light up. This project was very solder heavy and I got a lot of practice painstakingly soldering connections. I had trouble soldering the battery holder on, and therefore I had a lot of issues with the project before I finally managed to solder it properly and get it to work.
